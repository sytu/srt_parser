2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,260
*Don't you wanna go down*

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,690
*Don't you wanna go down*

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,390
*Don't you wanna go down*

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,820
Somebody make some motherfucking noise in here!

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,080
Fuck these people.

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,850
Man, this place is unbelievable.

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,100
Fucking Goolybib, man.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,860
Those guys build a mediocre piece of software,

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,640
that might be worth something someday,

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,080
and now they live here.

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,180
There's money flying all over Silicon Valley

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,000
but none of it ever seems to hit us.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,230
What the hell are you eating?

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,280
Liquid shrimp. It's 200 dollars a quart.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,920
Wylie Dufresne made it.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,670
How does it taste?

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,960
Like how I would imagine cum tastes.

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,170
You guys taking it all in?

20
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,340
Because this is what it looks like

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,080
when Google acquires your company for over 200 million dollars.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,480
Look, Dustin Moskovitz.

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,740
Elon Musk. Eric Schmidt.

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,560
Whatever the fuck the guy's name is who created Photrio.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,780
I mean, Kid Rock is the poorest person here.

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,320
Apart from you guys.

29
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,740
OK, there's 40 billion dollars

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,880
of net worth, walking around this party.

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,080
And you guys are standing around drinking shrimp

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,080
and talking about what cum tastes like.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,570
Yeah, I heard that.

34
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,460
You guys live in my incubator

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,360
you've got to network. That's why I brought you here.

36
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,000
I got us in here.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,470
Javeed over there is my ex-room-mate.

38
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,770
Yeah, but I drove.

39
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,670
Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.

40
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,740
It's amazing how the men and women at these things

41
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,260
always separate like this.

42
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,730
Yeah, every party in Silicon Valley

43
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,740
ends up like a Hasidic wedding.

44
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,700
Not even the Goolybib guys were talking to girls.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,400
They don't have to, Big Head.

46
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,280
This house talks to girls.

47
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,610
I got seven words for you.

48
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,820
I love

49
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,750
Goolybib's integrated-

50
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,540
multi-platform-functionality!

51
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,400
But seriously,

52
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,430
you know, a few days ago,

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,480
when we were sitting down with Barak Obama,

54
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,300
I turned to these guys and said,

55
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,940
"OK, you know, we're making a lot of money.

56
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,490
And yes, we're disrupting digital media.

57
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,820
But most importantly

58
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,000
we're making the world a better place.

59
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,830
Through constructing elegant hierarchies

60
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,390
for maximum code reuse and extensibility."

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,350
So everyone.

62
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,160
Here's to many more nights just like this one.

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,910
Take it away, my good friend, Kid Rock.

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,020
What a dick.

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,610
Big Head, there is a personal ad section

66
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,080
on this Asperger site.

67
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,690
Holy shit, this one is looking for

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,360
a "Relationship that has the potential to become

69
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,860
sexual in nature."

70
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,560
Boy, is she on the spectrum.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,210
She can't even make eye contact with the camera.

72
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,090
Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,170
Solo.

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,250
We need to talk about Pied Piper.

75
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,890
What about it? The website's up and running,

76
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,320
I'm just redesigning the compression. It just needs users.

77
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,140
Yeah, no shit.

78
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,890
But even if somebody wanted to use it

79
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,390
they wouldn't be able to figure out how to.

80
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,020
It's incomprehensible.

81
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,490
Now, Richard, when you pitched me Pied Piper

82
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,580
you said it was gonna be, "The Google of Music."

83
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,500
which is a really rad way to pitch something.

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,310
I mean, I liked it.

85
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,920
I thought it had "Applications".

86
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,900
No, it has all that. Look, when it blows up,

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,620
and it will once it reaches a critical mass of users,

88
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,780
Pied Piper will be able to search the whole world

89
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,140
of recorded music to find out if there's a match to see

90
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,320
if you're infringing on any copy righted material.

91
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,580
So, if you're a song writer or a band...

92
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,170
OK, first of all, nobody gives a shit

93
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,530
about stealing other people's music, OK?

94
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,350
Everybody involved in the music industry

95
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,690
is either stealing it or sharing it.

96
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,250
They're all a bunch of assholes, especially Radiohead.

97
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,330
- Look, Richard... - No.

98
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,300
Yeah, they're assholes.

99
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,950
Now, look, Richard, if you want to live here,

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,410
you've got to deliver.

101
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,570
I can't have dead weight at my incubator, OK?

102
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,710
Either that, or show some promise for fuck's sake.

103
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,160
Like NipAlert. Big Head's app.

104
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,230
It gives you the location of a woman with erect nipples.

105
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,730
Now, that's something people want.

106
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,250
Richard, you need to get in touch with humanity.

107
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,240
When I sold my company, Aviato,

108
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,280
I wanted to give back. That's why I started this place,

109
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,710
to do something big. To make a difference.

110
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,400
You know, like Steve.

111
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,230
Uh, Jobs or Wozniak?

113
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,790
Steve Jobs or Steve...

114
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,960
Oh, I heard you.

115
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,090
- Which one? - Jobs.

116
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,530
I mean, Jobs was a poser. He didn't even write code.

117
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,950
You just disappeared up your own asshole.

118
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,530
- You know that? You did. - Well, technically...

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,300
Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.

120
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,610
He knew how to package the ideas,

121
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,970
but it was Wozniak that...

122
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,670
What is Hooli? Excellent question.

123
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,380
Hooli isn't just another high tech company.

124
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,320
Hooli isn't just about software.

125
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,660
Hooli. Hooli is about people.

126
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,460
Hooli is about innovative technology

127
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,100
that makes a difference,

128
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,510
transforming the world as we know it.

129
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,270
Making the world a better place,

130
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,230
through minimal message oriented transport layers.

132
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,360
I firmly believe we can only achieve greatness

133
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,570
if first we achieve goodness.

134
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,650
Erlich is gonna kick me out.

135
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,890
And I can't afford to pay rent here.

136
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,210
It's insane. $2800 a month,

137
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,890
$4500 a month... with five people.

138
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,360
Jesus! Why is it so expensive here?

139
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,110
Look at this place, it's a shithole.

140
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,990
Here's another one.

141
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,890
Miss Palo Alto, 2K14.

142
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,150
There she goes.

144
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,860
Oh God, the marketing team is having another bike meeting.

145
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,210
Douchebags.

146
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,150
Yup, another day inside the Gavin Belson cult compound.

147
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,850
Hey, did you hear what Peter Gregory is doing?

148
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,620
You mean buying that island in the Pacific?

149
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,740
No, he's building one actually.

150
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,890
Baller.

151
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,060
Anyway, he's also offering a hundred K

152
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,910
to people willing to skip or drop out of college

153
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,540
to pursue their idea.

154
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,990
I don't know what happened to that guy,

155
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,400
but he really hates college.

156
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,950
Anyway, he's doing a TED TALKS in Palo Alto tonight.

158
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,640
- Should we try to get in? - I dropped out of college.

159
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,570
Maybe I should re-enroll and drop out again.

160
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,800
Try and get the money.

161
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,500
Brogrammers.

164
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,140
Oh, no, no.

165
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,280
Hey, uh, a double macchiato for me, dude.

166
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,330
Yeah.

167
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,550
Hey, Rico, you been working out?

168
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,400
No. No, I have not.

169
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,550
I don't have time to even if I wanted to.

170
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm too busy working on my website.

171
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,970
Uh, I just, I don't want to end up being a Hooli lifer.

172
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,470
You know, working here forever.

173
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,690
Yeah, working for the most innovative company in the world,

174
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,750
with top pay and vested stock options.

175
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,760
I can totally see why you wouldn't want that.

176
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,290
Yeah, you're like an artist. An entrepreneur.

177
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,340
An iconoclast.

178
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,870
I don't know, maybe.

179
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,080
Dude, We're just messing with you.

180
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
But we really want to help you with your site.

181
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,690
What's it called?

182
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,560
Pied Piper.

183
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,530
- Dude, sounds amazing. - Yeah.

184
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,740
Why don't you shoot it over to us and we'll give it a look.

185
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,880
Maybe we can help.

186
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,140
- Uh, really? - Yeah.

187
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,500
OK, yeah.

188
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,380
I mean it's always good to have more eyes on it.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,340
It's... Sent it.

190
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,900
You're making fun of me.

191
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,040
- Dude, no. - No, you are.

192
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,440
- Aw, Ricky, man. - Ricky. Ricky, come back.

193
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,390
It's actually Richard, so that's...

194
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,100
- Pied wiper. - Wide diaper.

195
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,820
Gates, Ellison,

196
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,670
Jobs, Dell.

197
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,710
All dropped out of college.

198
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,020
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation

199
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,430
because of drop outs.

200
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,770
College... has become a cruel

201
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,570
expensive joke on the poor

202
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,600
and the middle class

203
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,850
that benefits only the perpetrators of it.

204
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,700
- The bloated administrators... - You are a dangerous man,

205
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,360
spewing ignorance!

206
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,360
I don't think so.

207
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,720
I'm just saying people should trust themselves

208
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,170
more than a system

209
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,020
that happily churns out unemployed debtors

210
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,350
and provides dubious value.

211
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,700
The true value of a college education is intangible.

212
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,470
The true value of snake-oil is intangible as well.

213
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,840
Fascist.

214
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,450
Anything?

215
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,830
The usual riffs on Twitter and Instagram.

216
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,100
Nothing I'd fund.

217
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,200
Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?

218
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,180
I have an idea I'd love to pitch you, if you have time.

219
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,140
Well, that is before I just give up and go back to college.

220
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,470
Don't! Do not do that.

221
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,230
Go work at Burger King.

222
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,370
Go into the woods and forage for nuts and berries.

223
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,550
Do not go back to college!

224
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,390
I think I have been played.

225
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,880
Fine. Go ahead and pitch.

226
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,190
You have until I fasten the seatbelt in my car.

227
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,450
Thank you so much.

228
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,740
Pied Piper is a proprietary site that lets you find out

229
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,680
if your music is infringing on any existing copyrights.

230
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,910
So, imagine you were a song writer, OK?

231
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,770
I don't think I could write a song.

232
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,830
Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

233
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,700
I don't even think I could say,

234
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,380
"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,620
Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

236
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,230
Crunching all those songs to find matches

237
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,360
sounds like it would take incredible processing power.

238
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
- I mean... - Yes.

239
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,270
Yes, it does.

240
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,250
No, no. Its... I made an algorithm.

241
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,980
Look, why don't you send me a link to your project

242
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,850
and we'll take a look.

243
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,030
OK, yeah, great.

244
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,840
I put the prototype up on Github.

246
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,310
Pied Piper. I'll look it up.

247
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,290
It's like the fable with the kids

248
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,560
and then the rats and the music.

249
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,920
That is a narrow car.

250
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,630
Fucking billionaires.

252
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,700
Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,250
Yes, I do.

254
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,410
You have to download your own media player?

255
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,020
Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.

256
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,210
Wait a sec.

257
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,720
What is this file size?

258
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,390
1.2 Megabytes? No way.

259
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,130
Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

260
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,530
The file size is like, half.

261
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,540
And look how fast this search is.

262
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,020
Holy shit, how did it find a match that fast?

263
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,310
It's like it's searching compressed files?

264
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,390
No way.

267
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,520
Look at that Weissman score.

268
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,830
2.89.

269
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,400
Hey, Where have you two been?

270
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,890
We're playing the multi-channel router team in five minutes.

271
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,860
OK, how the hell did he do this?

272
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,640
And the compression is totally lossless.

273
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,390
And he's somehow figured out

274
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,770
a way to do a search on a compressed data space.

275
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,010
- Holy shit. - Yeah.

276
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,990
And I don't think he even realizes what he has here.

277
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,360
He's using it for some silly songwriter app.

278
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,910
All these guys are like that, they're all about consumer facing.

279
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,720
Right, but you take something like this,

280
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,430
make it business facing and use it for enterprise?

281
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,490
The applications could be endless.

282
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,510
Hey, I thought you were a Satanist?

283
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,970
I'm a LaVeyan Satanist with some theistic tendencies.

284
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,290
Oh, some theistic tendencies.

285
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,020
Well then, what's with the cross?

286
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,990
It's an upside down cross.

287
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,650
Not from here it isn't.

288
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,570
Oh, I see, you know what you should do?

289
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,530
You should get another tattoo that says, "This side up" on it.

290
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,100
How does this translate into Farsi?

291
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,820
That's not the language I speak.

292
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,820
Frontier Airlines just happened to like mine, Aviato.

293
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,750
And that's how I got to where I am.

294
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,500
So... what do you got?

295
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,830
OK, here it is.

296
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,680
Bit Soup.

298
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,630
It's like alphabet soup but

299
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,780
it's ones and zeros instead of the letters.

300
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,430
'Cause it's binary.

301
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,050
You know, binary is just ones and zeroes.

302
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,580
Yeah, I know what binary is.

303
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,150
Jesus Christ! I memorized the hexadecimal times tables

304
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,250
when I was 14 writing machine code!

305
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,930
OK. Ask me what nine times F is. It's fleventyfive.

307
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,570
I do not need you telling me what binary is,

308
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,570
just like I don't need you

309
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,310
thinking about soup or taking pictures of it.

310
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,140
I need you thinking about apps, software, websites.

311
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,480
This is Silicon Valley, all right, not...

312
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,550
Paris, Texas.

313
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,010
That's where Campbell's Soup is.

314
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,020
It's the Hooli number again.

315
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,470
It's probably those brogrammers.

316
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,110
Can't wait to tell me how stupid my website is.

317
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,200
Assholes.

318
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,790
Hello, Richard Hendricks. I'm a total fucking retard.

319
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,740
Hi, this is Jared Dunn calling from Hooli.

320
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,520
I'm calling a behalf of Gavin Belson.

321
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,000
I didn't... hi.

322
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,870
Gavin is very excited about your Pied Piper application

323
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,680
and we were wondering if you could come in

324
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,320
for a sit-down with us.

325
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,540
- Are you available now. - OK.

326
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,750
- Sure. Yes. - OK, we'll be here.

327
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,740
Good-bye.

328
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,690
Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

329
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,090
He likes Pied Piper.

330
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,950
I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.

331
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,400
You said it was a shitty idea.

332
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,070
It was a shitty idea.

333
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,030
I'm not sure what it is now.

334
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,390
- What time's the meeting? - Right now.

335
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,920
I'm gonna need a better shirt.

336
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,760
Holy shit.

337
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,590
What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.

338
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,670
Well, it's like Gavin always says,

339
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,690
"It takes change to make change."

340
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,180
Yeah, I think I've seen that written around.

341
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,570
Gavin is running 30 minutes late

342
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,200
but you should know he is very excited to see you, Richard.

343
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,840
He's with his spiritual advisor.

344
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,270
He shouldn't be that much longer.

345
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,140
I'm a VP here

346
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,540
and I only get to see him about ten minutes a month.

347
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,720
But that 10 minutes is just incredible.

348
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,230
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

349
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,640
Have you ever met Gavin before?

350
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,220
- No. - No?

351
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,260
Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

352
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,760
That hardly begins to describe it.

353
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,510
It's weird.

354
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,890
They always travel in groups of five.

355
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,350
These programmers, there's always a tall skinny white guy,

356
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,290
short skinny Asian guy,

357
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,270
fat guy with a ponytail,

358
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,820
some guy with crazy facial hair

359
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,740
and then an East Indian guy.

360
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,520
It's like they trade guys

361
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,050
until they all have the right group.

362
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,980
You clearly have a great understanding of humanity.

363
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,880
And Gavin said: I'm not humiliating you,

364
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm elevating you.

365
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,690
Ah, Gavin.

366
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,260
This is Richard.

367
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,920
It's Peter Gregory.

368
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,680
Ah, no.

373
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,060
Come on, Big Head.

374
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,850
Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

375
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,610
Why are you going that fast?

376
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,000
Cause we've got a meeting with Gavin Belson. Pick up the pace.

377
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,210
- We honestly don't. - Come on.

378
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,910
I'm actually outside of

379
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,750
Gavin Belson's office right now, Mr. Gregory.

380
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,670
Uh, here he comes, so can I call you back in a second...

381
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,730
So, Richard Hendricks is here!

382
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,830
There you are, Richard.

383
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,880
So sorry these gentleman have kept you waiting.

384
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,710
- That's fine. - So here's the thing.

385
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,110
I love what you did.

386
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,430
- Really? - Fill him in, Jared.

387
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,240
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly

388
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,530
the most progressive company in the world.

389
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,470
Part of that is Gavin's commitment to social justice,

390
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,760
but part of it is his personal commitment

391
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,510
to the people that work at Hooli.

392
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,890
In that spirit Gavin is

393
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,020
prepared to give you a very substantial raise...

394
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,570
and a promotion to go with it.

395
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,310
I own 10 percent.

396
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,490
He created it while living in my incubator.

397
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,510
Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

398
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,180
I don't know what any of that means,

399
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,100
but I'll give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.

400
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,120
We have the reach and the resources to take what you have done

401
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,970
and push it to the global level.

402
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,350
That is a generous offer.

403
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,340
Shit, sorry. Hello.

404
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,700
Really? No shit, that's...

405
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,750
Uh, yeah, yeah. No here. It's Peter Gregory.

406
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,090
Not sure how he got my number?

407
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,740
Uh, this is Richard.

408
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,220
I'll give you three million dollars for it right now!

409
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,440
Ah, Gavin Belson just offered

410
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,180
me three million dollars for Pied Piper.

411
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,340
I'm prepared to give you three hundred thousand dollars.

412
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,330
Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um...

413
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,030
Did you say thousand dollars?

414
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,510
For ten percent of your company.

415
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,000
OK, four million.

416
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,600
200 thousand.

417
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,120
- For five percent. - Huh?

418
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,520
You just went down.

419
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,530
No, you're still valued at four million dollars.

420
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,200
But you own ninety-five

421
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,880
percent of a potential billion-dollar company.

422
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,500
And not just that, I will help you build this company.

423
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,990
I will introduce you to the people you need to know

424
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,580
and provide the counsel that you need.

425
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,900
I will take a small piece, but the company will belong to you.

426
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,690
not Gavin Belson.

427
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,920
You have until tomorrow to decide.

428
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,420
Ah, OK.

429
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,540
- Um, you know... - Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

430
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm offering you four million dollars right now.

431
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,270
I'm....

432
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,550
That is a lot of money.

433
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,910
You know, I actually have to...

434
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,470
I've got to go to the bathroom.

435
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,760
I've got to pee.

436
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,790
It's desperate. I'm bursting.

437
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,370
I'll be right back, but right now...

438
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,470
OK, 10 million.

439
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,680
No. Maybe.

440
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,440
I didn't mean to snap at you.

441
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,290
I'll talk... in a bit.

442
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,220
Won't be long.

443
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,720
Little more about me.

444
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,680
I am the founder of Aviato.

445
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,380
and I own a very small percentage of Grindr.

446
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,040
It's a men to men dating site

447
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,320
where you can find other men within 10 miles of you,

448
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,100
interested in having sexual intercourse in a public restroom.

449
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,440
In the homosexual community there's sometimes anonymous...

450
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,780
I know what Grindr is.

451
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,710
I have gay friends.

453
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,730
So you will survive.

454
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,910
It's just a garden-variety panic attack.

455
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,840
Welcome to Silicon Valley.

456
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,870
We see people like you all the time.

457
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,410
- Really? - Yes.

458
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,850
It's just I have to make this decision by tomorrow.

459
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,380
Yeah. You know, a while back, we had a guy in here,

460
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,850
in almost the exact same situation,

461
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,460
"Take the money or keep the company."

462
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,660
What happened?

463
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,360
Well, a couple months later

464
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,770
he was brought into the ER with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

465
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,760
I guess he really regretted not taking that money.

466
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,050
He shot himself because he turned down the money?

467
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,900
Yeah.

468
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,480
Or no, he took the money.

469
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,840
Or no.

470
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,480
No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

471
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,110
I don't remember. But whatever it was,

472
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,270
he regretted it so much that he ended up shooting himself.

473
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,090
- And now he's blind. - He's blind?

474
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,990
Yeah, just FYI,

475
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,170
if you're ever gonna shoot yourself,

476
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,630
don't hold the gun up to your temple, OK?

477
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,810
Because that just basically just took out

478
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,560
both of his optic nerves and then, you know,

479
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,940
half of his face.

480
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,900
And then his wife left him, because, you know.

481
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,280
- Yikes. - Right.

482
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,320
He may have been a genius programmer

483
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,760
but not so much in human anatomy.

484
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,700
Or decision making, for that matter.

485
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,620
Now he's got to live with all that

486
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,260
and whatever terrible decision he made about the money.

487
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,520
Uh. And what do I do if I feel another panic attack coming on.

488
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,990
Would you be interested in a device

489
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,100
that links up to your smartphone

490
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,600
and it keeps track of your vitals

491
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,390
and it tells you, even before it's happening,

492
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,980
whether you're having a panic attack or an actual heart attack?

493
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,490
Yeah, that sounds great.

494
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,770
You would, right?

495
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,780
OK, that's great news.

496
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,980
Because it's still in prototype phase right now,

497
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,860
but my start-up partners and I are looking for investors.

498
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,570
Like today.

499
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,970
So will you please let me know...

500
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,090
I'm going to give you my number.

501
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,100
If you do end up taking that 10 million dollars

502
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,140
because we could really make the world a better place.

503
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,540
Whoa! Oh, jeez!

504
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,650
Richard.

505
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,790
Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.

506
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,920
We met outside the TED...

507
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,950
Yeah, I remember you.

508
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,140
What... How'd you know I was here?

509
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,800
Peter Gregory is investing in a company

510
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,350
that uses GPS in phones to track people.

511
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,180
That's creepy.

512
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,730
You don't know the half of it.

513
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,650
And neither does Congress.

514
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,270
Are you OK?

515
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,050
Look, I don't want to waste your time.

516
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,460
I think I gotta take the money from Gavin Belson.

517
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,830
At least this way when I blow my eyeballs out

518
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,980
I'll have some money left for my family.

519
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,020
Jesus.

520
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,710
Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

521
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,220
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

522
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,070
is a compression algorithm that blew our engineering team away.

523
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,520
And what do you think Hooli is going to do with it?

524
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,850
I don't know. That's their business.

525
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,250
This is your baby.

526
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,660
Do you even realize the impact that a compression

527
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,420
this good could have on the world?

528
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,550
Getting any file on your mobile phone in an instant.

529
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,220
Navigation data for self-driving cars,

530
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,690
mobile medical imagery,

531
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,400
all transmitting with no quality loss.

532
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,070
This is game-changing.

533
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,110
Don't you want to be in the driver's seat when that happens?

534
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,500
You really want to just turn it all over to Hooli

535
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,550
and walk away?

536
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,250
Well, you are not making this easier for me.

537
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,160
I'm not trying to.

538
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,120
I mean you're actually making it worse.

539
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,520
My hands are tingling. I have this metal taste in my mouth.

540
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,530
Actually, I can't go back in there, so I'm going to go home.

541
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,800
- Good to see you again. - Let me give you a ride home.

542
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,630
Uh, OK. Thanks.

543
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,750
Dude, where have you been?

544
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,010
Why won't you answer your phone?

545
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,120
Man, this has grown way beyond AngelList.

547
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,140
Andreesen, Elevation and like a bunch of

548
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,620
other seed funds are piling onto this thing.

549
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,340
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

550
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,680
He's out of control.

551
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,320
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200K

552
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,650
and built our own company?

553
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,560
I'm sorry. You said we.

554
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,500
Who's that in reference to exactly?

555
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,210
You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

556
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,390
I mean, right now Pied Piper just does audio,

557
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,650
but I'm thinking of ways to compress images, video...

558
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,180
I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.

559
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,550
Maybe this could be huge.

560
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,810
Look, guys, for thousands of years

561
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,560
guys like us have gotten the shit kicked out of us.

562
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,180
But now, for the first time, we are living in an era

563
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,240
where we can be in charge and build empires.

564
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,720
We could be the Vikings of our day.

565
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,780
- Vikings? - How are you feeling?

566
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,440
You look super fucked up, to be honest.

567
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,970
Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

568
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,050
So you're really about to go tell Erlich

569
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,760
that he's not going to get his one million dollars?

570
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,840
Yeah, I don't want to be there when you do that.

571
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,490
I would like to be there when you do that.

572
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,310
No, just stay here, please.

573
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,130
Um, so, I've been thinking about

574
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,290
this whole Peter Gregory, Gavin Belson thing.

575
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,810
And, um, I think I'm going to go with Peter Gregory.

576
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,150
- Uh, which I know means... - Richard.

577
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,940
I know that you look at me,

578
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,100
and see a guy who has it all figured out.

579
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,460
And for the most part, you're right, I do.

580
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,620
When I sold Aviato,

581
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,340
it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

582
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,460
the universal respect of all the ladies.

583
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,130
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

584
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,240
Not a literal hole like you would find

585
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,890
in some babies with congenital diseases,

586
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,240
but a metaphorical hole.

587
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,380
I guess that hole is the "what if".

588
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,120
What if I didn't sell?

589
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,530
I'll never know.

590
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,810
And so I guess what I'm saying to you now is,

591
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,670
you're like me, Richard.

592
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,910
You want to build something

593
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,440
and see it through.

594
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,420
So, just to be clear.

595
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,680
You're all right with me saying no to a deal

596
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,510
that will net you a million dollars outright?

597
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,190
No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

598
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,870
I'm excited about it.

599
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,770
Let's see how high this rocket can fly, partner.

600
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,220
OK. Great.

601
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,390
That's great.

602
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,080
Not partners, exactly.

603
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,520
But everything else is great.

604
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,920
Call it what you want.

605
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,650
Always blue, always blue, always blue,

606
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,230
always blue, always blue, always blue,

607
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,000
always blue, always...

608
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,120
Oh! That was a yellow.

609
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,490
What was that, 17?

610
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,110
- Pretty good. - Hey, guys...

611
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,150
Guys, can I just kind of say something real quick?

612
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,440
I know it's stupid but, um...

613
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,040
I just want to say, uh,

614
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,490
I'd like for this company to be different than Hooli

615
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,640
and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

616
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,280
Like, let's like not turn this into a corporate cult

617
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,890
with bike meetings and voluntary retreats

618
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,230
that are actually mandatory.

619
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,030
And claiming to make the world a better place all the time.

620
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,740
Let's, uh, let's just think different.

621
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,030
Don't think different. That's Apple.

622
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,360
Let's just... let's just do it.

623
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,870
- That's Nike, man. - I know that's Nike.

624
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,090
Fuck it. I don't know.

625
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,940
Let's just make it... Let's just make it happen.

626
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,380
Yeah, agreed.

627
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,420
To his beneficence.

628
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,700
Peter Gregory?

629
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,780
- The Dark Lord. - Of course, the Dark Lord.

630
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,200
Big Head.

631
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,720
God, he's worse high.

632
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,670
Always blue, always blue,

633
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,730
always blue, always blue...
