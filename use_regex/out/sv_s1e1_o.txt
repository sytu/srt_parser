Richard: 		*Don't you wanna go down*

Erlich : 		*Don't you wanna go down*

Richard: 		*Don't you wanna go down*

Dinesh: 		Somebody make some motherfucking noise in here!

Stanley Lin: 		Fuck these people.

Erlich : 		Man, this place is unbelievable.

Stanley Lin: 		Fucking Goolybib, man.

Richard: 		Those guys build a mediocre piece of software,

Erlich : 		that might be worth something someday,

Dinesh: 		and now they live here.

Stanley Lin: 		There's money flying all over Silicon Valley

Stanley Lin: 		but none of it ever seems to hit us.

Stanley Lin: 		What the hell are you eating?

Richard: 		Liquid shrimp. It's 200 dollars a quart.

Dinesh: 		Wylie Dufresne made it.

Stanley Lin: 		How does it taste?

Erlich : 		Like how I would imagine cum tastes.

Stanley Lin: 		You guys taking it all in?

Stanley Lin: 		Because this is what it looks like

Stanley Lin: 		when Google acquires your company for over 200 million dollars.

Richard: 		Look, Dustin Moskovitz.

Stanley Lin: 		Elon Musk. Eric Schmidt.

Erlich : 		Whatever the fuck the guy's name is who created Photrio.

Stanley Lin: 		I mean, Kid Rock is the poorest person here.

Stanley Lin: 		Apart from you guys.

Stanley Lin: 		OK, there's 40 billion dollars

Dinesh: 		of net worth, walking around this party.

Richard: 		And you guys are standing around drinking shrimp

Stanley Lin: 		and talking about what cum tastes like.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, I heard that.

Stanley Lin: 		You guys live in my incubator

Stanley Lin: 		you've got to network. That's why I brought you here.

Stanley Lin: 		I got us in here.

Stanley Lin: 		Javeed over there is my ex-room-mate.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, but I drove.

Stanley Lin: 		Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.

Stanley Lin: 		It's amazing how the men and women at these things

Stanley Lin: 		always separate like this.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, every party in Silicon Valley

Stanley Lin: 		ends up like a Hasidic wedding.

Stanley Lin: 		Not even the Goolybib guys were talking to girls.

Stanley Lin: 		They don't have to, Big Head.

Stanley Lin: 		This house talks to girls.

Stanley Lin: 		I got seven words for you.

Stanley Lin: 		I love

Stanley Lin: 		Goolybib's integrated-

Stanley Lin: 		multi-platform-functionality!

Stanley Lin: 		But seriously,

Stanley Lin: 		you know, a few days ago,

Stanley Lin: 		when we were sitting down with Barak Obama,

Stanley Lin: 		I turned to these guys and said,

Stanley Lin: 		"OK, you know, we're making a lot of money.

Stanley Lin: 		And yes, we're disrupting digital media.

Stanley Lin: 		But most importantly

Stanley Lin: 		we're making the world a better place.

Stanley Lin: 		Through constructing elegant hierarchies

Stanley Lin: 		for maximum code reuse and extensibility."

Stanley Lin: 		So everyone.

Stanley Lin: 		Here's to many more nights just like this one.

Stanley Lin: 		Take it away, my good friend, Kid Rock.

Stanley Lin: 		What a dick.

Stanley Lin: 		Big Head, there is a personal ad section

Stanley Lin: 		on this Asperger site.

Stanley Lin: 		Holy shit, this one is looking for

Stanley Lin: 		a "Relationship that has the potential to become

Stanley Lin: 		sexual in nature."

Stanley Lin: 		Boy, is she on the spectrum.

Stanley Lin: 		She can't even make eye contact with the camera.

Stanley Lin: 		Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

Stanley Lin: 		Solo.

Stanley Lin: 		We need to talk about Pied Piper.

Stanley Lin: 		What about it? The website's up and running,

Stanley Lin: 		I'm just redesigning the compression. It just needs users.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, no shit.

Stanley Lin: 		But even if somebody wanted to use it

Stanley Lin: 		they wouldn't be able to figure out how to.

Stanley Lin: 		It's incomprehensible.

Stanley Lin: 		Now, Richard, when you pitched me Pied Piper

Stanley Lin: 		you said it was gonna be, "The Google of Music."

Stanley Lin: 		which is a really rad way to pitch something.

Stanley Lin: 		I mean, I liked it.

Stanley Lin: 		I thought it had "Applications".

Stanley Lin: 		No, it has all that. Look, when it blows up,

Stanley Lin: 		and it will once it reaches a critical mass of users,

Stanley Lin: 		Pied Piper will be able to search the whole world

Stanley Lin: 		of recorded music to find out if there's a match to see

Stanley Lin: 		if you're infringing on any copy righted material.

Stanley Lin: 		So, if you're a song writer or a band...

Stanley Lin: 		OK, first of all, nobody gives a shit

Stanley Lin: 		about stealing other people's music, OK?

Stanley Lin: 		Everybody involved in the music industry

Stanley Lin: 		is either stealing it or sharing it.

Stanley Lin: 		They're all a bunch of assholes, especially Radiohead.

Stanley Lin: 		- Look, Richard... - No.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, they're assholes.

Stanley Lin: 		Now, look, Richard, if you want to live here,

Stanley Lin: 		you've got to deliver.

Stanley Lin: 		I can't have dead weight at my incubator, OK?

Stanley Lin: 		Either that, or show some promise for fuck's sake.

Stanley Lin: 		Like NipAlert. Big Head's app.

Stanley Lin: 		It gives you the location of a woman with erect nipples.

Stanley Lin: 		Now, that's something people want.

Stanley Lin: 		Richard, you need to get in touch with humanity.

Stanley Lin: 		When I sold my company, Aviato,

Stanley Lin: 		I wanted to give back. That's why I started this place,

Stanley Lin: 		to do something big. To make a difference.

Stanley Lin: 		You know, like Steve.

Stanley Lin: 		Uh, Jobs or Wozniak?

Stanley Lin: 		Steve Jobs or Steve...

Stanley Lin: 		Oh, I heard you.

Stanley Lin: 		- Which one? - Jobs.

Stanley Lin: 		I mean, Jobs was a poser. He didn't even write code.

Stanley Lin: 		You just disappeared up your own asshole.

Stanley Lin: 		- You know that? You did. - Well, technically...

Stanley Lin: 		Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.

Stanley Lin: 		He knew how to package the ideas,

Stanley Lin: 		but it was Wozniak that...

Stanley Lin: 		What is Hooli? Excellent question.

Stanley Lin: 		Hooli isn't just another high tech company.

Stanley Lin: 		Hooli isn't just about software.

Stanley Lin: 		Hooli. Hooli is about people.

Stanley Lin: 		Hooli is about innovative technology

Stanley Lin: 		that makes a difference,

Stanley Lin: 		transforming the world as we know it.

Stanley Lin: 		Making the world a better place,

Stanley Lin: 		through minimal message oriented transport layers.

Stanley Lin: 		I firmly believe we can only achieve greatness

Stanley Lin: 		if first we achieve goodness.

Stanley Lin: 		Erlich is gonna kick me out.

Stanley Lin: 		And I can't afford to pay rent here.

Stanley Lin: 		It's insane. $2800 a month,

Stanley Lin: 		$4500 a month... with five people.

Stanley Lin: 		Jesus! Why is it so expensive here?

Stanley Lin: 		Look at this place, it's a shithole.

Stanley Lin: 		Here's another one.

Stanley Lin: 		Miss Palo Alto, 2K14.

Stanley Lin: 		There she goes.

Stanley Lin: 		Oh God, the marketing team is having another bike meeting.

Stanley Lin: 		Douchebags.

Stanley Lin: 		Yup, another day inside the Gavin Belson cult compound.

Stanley Lin: 		Hey, did you hear what Peter Gregory is doing?

Stanley Lin: 		You mean buying that island in the Pacific?

Stanley Lin: 		No, he's building one actually.

Stanley Lin: 		Baller.

Stanley Lin: 		Anyway, he's also offering a hundred K

Stanley Lin: 		to people willing to skip or drop out of college

Stanley Lin: 		to pursue their idea.

Stanley Lin: 		I don't know what happened to that guy,

Stanley Lin: 		but he really hates college.

Stanley Lin: 		Anyway, he's doing a TED TALKS in Palo Alto tonight.

Stanley Lin: 		- Should we try to get in? - I dropped out of college.

Stanley Lin: 		Maybe I should re-enroll and drop out again.

Stanley Lin: 		Try and get the money.

Stanley Lin: 		Brogrammers.

Stanley Lin: 		Oh, no, no.

Stanley Lin: 		Hey, uh, a double macchiato for me, dude.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah.

Stanley Lin: 		Hey, Rico, you been working out?

Stanley Lin: 		No. No, I have not.

Stanley Lin: 		I don't have time to even if I wanted to.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm too busy working on my website.

Stanley Lin: 		Uh, I just, I don't want to end up being a Hooli lifer.

Stanley Lin: 		You know, working here forever.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, working for the most innovative company in the world,

Stanley Lin: 		with top pay and vested stock options.

Stanley Lin: 		I can totally see why you wouldn't want that.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, you're like an artist. An entrepreneur.

Stanley Lin: 		An iconoclast.

Stanley Lin: 		I don't know, maybe.

Stanley Lin: 		Dude, We're just messing with you.

Stanley Lin: 		But we really want to help you with your site.

Stanley Lin: 		What's it called?

Stanley Lin: 		Pied Piper.

Stanley Lin: 		- Dude, sounds amazing. - Yeah.

Stanley Lin: 		Why don't you shoot it over to us and we'll give it a look.

Stanley Lin: 		Maybe we can help.

Stanley Lin: 		- Uh, really? - Yeah.

Stanley Lin: 		OK, yeah.

Stanley Lin: 		I mean it's always good to have more eyes on it.

Stanley Lin: 		It's... Sent it.

Stanley Lin: 		You're making fun of me.

Stanley Lin: 		- Dude, no. - No, you are.

Stanley Lin: 		- Aw, Ricky, man. - Ricky. Ricky, come back.

Stanley Lin: 		It's actually Richard, so that's...

Stanley Lin: 		- Pied wiper. - Wide diaper.

Stanley Lin: 		Gates, Ellison,

Stanley Lin: 		Jobs, Dell.

Stanley Lin: 		All dropped out of college.

Stanley Lin: 		Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation

Stanley Lin: 		because of drop outs.

Stanley Lin: 		College... has become a cruel

Stanley Lin: 		expensive joke on the poor

Stanley Lin: 		and the middle class

Stanley Lin: 		that benefits only the perpetrators of it.

Stanley Lin: 		- The bloated administrators... - You are a dangerous man,

Stanley Lin: 		spewing ignorance!

Stanley Lin: 		I don't think so.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm just saying people should trust themselves

Stanley Lin: 		more than a system

Stanley Lin: 		that happily churns out unemployed debtors

Dinesh: 		and provides dubious value.

Stanley Lin: 		The true value of a college education is intangible.

Richard: 		The true value of snake-oil is intangible as well.

Richard: 		Fascist.

Richard: 		Anything?

Richard: 		The usual riffs on Twitter and Instagram.

Richard: 		Nothing I'd fund.

Richard: 		Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?

Richard: 		I have an idea I'd love to pitch you, if you have time.

Richard: 		Well, that is before I just give up and go back to college.

Richard: 		Don't! Do not do that.

Richard: 		Go work at Burger King.

Richard: 		Go into the woods and forage for nuts and berries.

Richard: 		Do not go back to college!

Richard: 		I think I have been played.

Stanley Lin: 		Fine. Go ahead and pitch.

Stanley Lin: 		You have until I fasten the seatbelt in my car.

Stanley Lin: 		Thank you so much.

Stanley Lin: 		Pied Piper is a proprietary site that lets you find out

Stanley Lin: 		if your music is infringing on any existing copyrights.

Stanley Lin: 		So, imagine you were a song writer, OK?

Stanley Lin: 		I don't think I could write a song.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

Stanley Lin: 		I don't even think I could say,

Stanley Lin: 		"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

Stanley Lin: 		Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

Stanley Lin: 		Crunching all those songs to find matches

Stanley Lin: 		sounds like it would take incredible processing power.

Stanley Lin: 		- I mean... - Yes.

Stanley Lin: 		Yes, it does.

Stanley Lin: 		No, no. Its... I made an algorithm.

Stanley Lin: 		Look, why don't you send me a link to your project

Stanley Lin: 		and we'll take a look.

Stanley Lin: 		OK, yeah, great.

Stanley Lin: 		I put the prototype up on Github.

Stanley Lin: 		Pied Piper. I'll look it up.

Stanley Lin: 		It's like the fable with the kids

Stanley Lin: 		and then the rats and the music.

Stanley Lin: 		That is a narrow car.

Stanley Lin: 		Fucking billionaires.

Stanley Lin: 		Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?

Stanley Lin: 		Yes, I do.

Stanley Lin: 		You have to download your own media player?

Stanley Lin: 		Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.

Stanley Lin: 		Wait a sec.

Stanley Lin: 		What is this file size?

Stanley Lin: 		1.2 Megabytes? No way.

Stanley Lin: 		Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

Stanley Lin: 		The file size is like, half.

Stanley Lin: 		And look how fast this search is.

Stanley Lin: 		Holy shit, how did it find a match that fast?

Stanley Lin: 		It's like it's searching compressed files?

Stanley Lin: 		No way.

Stanley Lin: 		Look at that Weissman score.

Stanley Lin: 		2.89.

Stanley Lin: 		Hey, Where have you two been?

Stanley Lin: 		We're playing the multi-channel router team in five minutes.

Stanley Lin: 		OK, how the hell did he do this?

Stanley Lin: 		And the compression is totally lossless.

Stanley Lin: 		And he's somehow figured out

Stanley Lin: 		a way to do a search on a compressed data space.

Stanley Lin: 		- Holy shit. - Yeah.

Stanley Lin: 		And I don't think he even realizes what he has here.

Stanley Lin: 		He's using it for some silly songwriter app.

Stanley Lin: 		All these guys are like that, they're all about consumer facing.

Stanley Lin: 		Right, but you take something like this,

Stanley Lin: 		make it business facing and use it for enterprise?

Stanley Lin: 		The applications could be endless.

Stanley Lin: 		Hey, I thought you were a Satanist?

Stanley Lin: 		I'm a LaVeyan Satanist with some theistic tendencies.

Stanley Lin: 		Oh, some theistic tendencies.

Stanley Lin: 		Well then, what's with the cross?

Stanley Lin: 		It's an upside down cross.

Stanley Lin: 		Not from here it isn't.

Stanley Lin: 		Oh, I see, you know what you should do?

Stanley Lin: 		You should get another tattoo that says, "This side up" on it.

Stanley Lin: 		How does this translate into Farsi?

Stanley Lin: 		That's not the language I speak.

Stanley Lin: 		Frontier Airlines just happened to like mine, Aviato.

Stanley Lin: 		And that's how I got to where I am.

Stanley Lin: 		So... what do you got?

Stanley Lin: 		OK, here it is.

Stanley Lin: 		Bit Soup.

Stanley Lin: 		It's like alphabet soup but

Stanley Lin: 		it's ones and zeros instead of the letters.

Stanley Lin: 		'Cause it's binary.

Stanley Lin: 		You know, binary is just ones and zeroes.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, I know what binary is.

Stanley Lin: 		Jesus Christ! I memorized the hexadecimal times tables

Stanley Lin: 		when I was 14 writing machine code!

Stanley Lin: 		OK. Ask me what nine times F is. It's fleventyfive.

Stanley Lin: 		I do not need you telling me what binary is,

Stanley Lin: 		just like I don't need you

Stanley Lin: 		thinking about soup or taking pictures of it.

Stanley Lin: 		I need you thinking about apps, software, websites.

Stanley Lin: 		This is Silicon Valley, all right, not...

Stanley Lin: 		Paris, Texas.

Stanley Lin: 		That's where Campbell's Soup is.

Stanley Lin: 		It's the Hooli number again.

Stanley Lin: 		It's probably those brogrammers.

Stanley Lin: 		Can't wait to tell me how stupid my website is.

Stanley Lin: 		Assholes.

Stanley Lin: 		Hello, Richard Hendricks. I'm a total fucking retard.

Stanley Lin: 		Hi, this is Jared Dunn calling from Hooli.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm calling a behalf of Gavin Belson.

Stanley Lin: 		I didn't... hi.

Stanley Lin: 		Gavin is very excited about your Pied Piper application

Stanley Lin: 		and we were wondering if you could come in

Stanley Lin: 		for a sit-down with us.

Stanley Lin: 		- Are you available now. - OK.

Stanley Lin: 		- Sure. Yes. - OK, we'll be here.

Stanley Lin: 		Good-bye.

Stanley Lin: 		Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

Stanley Lin: 		He likes Pied Piper.

Stanley Lin: 		I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.

Stanley Lin: 		You said it was a shitty idea.

Stanley Lin: 		It was a shitty idea.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm not sure what it is now.

Stanley Lin: 		- What time's the meeting? - Right now.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm gonna need a better shirt.

Stanley Lin: 		Holy shit.

Stanley Lin: 		What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.

Stanley Lin: 		Well, it's like Gavin always says,

Stanley Lin: 		"It takes change to make change."

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, I think I've seen that written around.

Stanley Lin: 		Gavin is running 30 minutes late

Stanley Lin: 		but you should know he is very excited to see you, Richard.

Stanley Lin: 		He's with his spiritual advisor.

Stanley Lin: 		He shouldn't be that much longer.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm a VP here

Stanley Lin: 		and I only get to see him about ten minutes a month.

Stanley Lin: 		But that 10 minutes is just incredible.

Stanley Lin: 		I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

Stanley Lin: 		Have you ever met Gavin before?

Stanley Lin: 		- No. - No?

Stanley Lin: 		Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

Stanley Lin: 		That hardly begins to describe it.

Stanley Lin: 		It's weird.

Stanley Lin: 		They always travel in groups of five.

Stanley Lin: 		These programmers, there's always a tall skinny white guy,

Stanley Lin: 		short skinny Asian guy,

Stanley Lin: 		fat guy with a ponytail,

Stanley Lin: 		some guy with crazy facial hair

Stanley Lin: 		and then an East Indian guy.

Stanley Lin: 		It's like they trade guys

Stanley Lin: 		until they all have the right group.

Stanley Lin: 		You clearly have a great understanding of humanity.

Stanley Lin: 		And Gavin said: I'm not humiliating you,

Stanley Lin: 		I'm elevating you.

Stanley Lin: 		Ah, Gavin.

Stanley Lin: 		This is Richard.

Stanley Lin: 		It's Peter Gregory.

Stanley Lin: 		Ah, no.

Stanley Lin: 		Come on, Big Head.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

Stanley Lin: 		Why are you going that fast?

Stanley Lin: 		Cause we've got a meeting with Gavin Belson. Pick up the pace.

Stanley Lin: 		- We honestly don't. - Come on.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm actually outside of

Stanley Lin: 		Gavin Belson's office right now, Mr. Gregory.

Stanley Lin: 		Uh, here he comes, so can I call you back in a second...

Stanley Lin: 		So, Richard Hendricks is here!

Stanley Lin: 		There you are, Richard.

Stanley Lin: 		So sorry these gentleman have kept you waiting.

Stanley Lin: 		- That's fine. - So here's the thing.

Stanley Lin: 		I love what you did.

Stanley Lin: 		- Really? - Fill him in, Jared.

Stanley Lin: 		Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly

Stanley Lin: 		the most progressive company in the world.

Stanley Lin: 		Part of that is Gavin's commitment to social justice,

Stanley Lin: 		but part of it is his personal commitment

Stanley Lin: 		to the people that work at Hooli.

Stanley Lin: 		In that spirit Gavin is

Stanley Lin: 		prepared to give you a very substantial raise...

Stanley Lin: 		and a promotion to go with it.

Stanley Lin: 		I own 10 percent.

Stanley Lin: 		He created it while living in my incubator.

Stanley Lin: 		Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

Stanley Lin: 		I don't know what any of that means,

Stanley Lin: 		but I'll give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.

Stanley Lin: 		We have the reach and the resources to take what you have done

Stanley Lin: 		and push it to the global level.

Stanley Lin: 		That is a generous offer.

Stanley Lin: 		Shit, sorry. Hello.

Stanley Lin: 		Really? No shit, that's...

Stanley Lin: 		Uh, yeah, yeah. No here. It's Peter Gregory.

Stanley Lin: 		Not sure how he got my number?

Stanley Lin: 		Uh, this is Richard.

Stanley Lin: 		I'll give you three million dollars for it right now!

Stanley Lin: 		Ah, Gavin Belson just offered

Stanley Lin: 		me three million dollars for Pied Piper.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm prepared to give you three hundred thousand dollars.

Stanley Lin: 		Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um...

Stanley Lin: 		Did you say thousand dollars?

Stanley Lin: 		For ten percent of your company.

Stanley Lin: 		OK, four million.

Stanley Lin: 		200 thousand.

Stanley Lin: 		- For five percent. - Huh?

Stanley Lin: 		You just went down.

Stanley Lin: 		No, you're still valued at four million dollars.

Stanley Lin: 		But you own ninety-five

Stanley Lin: 		percent of a potential billion-dollar company.

Stanley Lin: 		And not just that, I will help you build this company.

Stanley Lin: 		I will introduce you to the people you need to know

Stanley Lin: 		and provide the counsel that you need.

Stanley Lin: 		I will take a small piece, but the company will belong to you.

Stanley Lin: 		not Gavin Belson.

Stanley Lin: 		You have until tomorrow to decide.

Stanley Lin: 		Ah, OK.

Stanley Lin: 		- Um, you know... - Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm offering you four million dollars right now.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm....

Stanley Lin: 		That is a lot of money.

Stanley Lin: 		You know, I actually have to...

Stanley Lin: 		I've got to go to the bathroom.

Stanley Lin: 		I've got to pee.

Stanley Lin: 		It's desperate. I'm bursting.

Stanley Lin: 		I'll be right back, but right now...

Stanley Lin: 		OK, 10 million.

Stanley Lin: 		No. Maybe.

Stanley Lin: 		I didn't mean to snap at you.

Stanley Lin: 		I'll talk... in a bit.

Stanley Lin: 		Won't be long.

Stanley Lin: 		Little more about me.

Stanley Lin: 		I am the founder of Aviato.

Stanley Lin: 		and I own a very small percentage of Grindr.

Stanley Lin: 		It's a men to men dating site

Stanley Lin: 		where you can find other men within 10 miles of you,

Stanley Lin: 		interested in having sexual intercourse in a public restroom.

Stanley Lin: 		In the homosexual community there's sometimes anonymous...

Stanley Lin: 		I know what Grindr is.

Stanley Lin: 		I have gay friends.

Stanley Lin: 		So you will survive.

Stanley Lin: 		It's just a garden-variety panic attack.

Stanley Lin: 		Welcome to Silicon Valley.

Stanley Lin: 		We see people like you all the time.

Stanley Lin: 		- Really? - Yes.

Stanley Lin: 		It's just I have to make this decision by tomorrow.

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah. You know, a while back, we had a guy in here,

Stanley Lin: 		in almost the exact same situation,

Stanley Lin: 		"Take the money or keep the company."

Stanley Lin: 		What happened?

Stanley Lin: 		Well, a couple months later

Stanley Lin: 		he was brought into the ER with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Stanley Lin: 		I guess he really regretted not taking that money.

Stanley Lin: 		He shot himself because he turned down the money?

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah.

Stanley Lin: 		Or no, he took the money.

Stanley Lin: 		Or no.

Stanley Lin: 		No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

Stanley Lin: 		I don't remember. But whatever it was,

Stanley Lin: 		he regretted it so much that he ended up shooting himself.

Stanley Lin: 		- And now he's blind. - He's blind?

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, just FYI,

Stanley Lin: 		if you're ever gonna shoot yourself,

Stanley Lin: 		don't hold the gun up to your temple, OK?

Stanley Lin: 		Because that just basically just took out

Stanley Lin: 		both of his optic nerves and then, you know,

Stanley Lin: 		half of his face.

Stanley Lin: 		And then his wife left him, because, you know.

Stanley Lin: 		- Yikes. - Right.

Stanley Lin: 		He may have been a genius programmer

Stanley Lin: 		but not so much in human anatomy.

Stanley Lin: 		Or decision making, for that matter.

Stanley Lin: 		Now he's got to live with all that

Stanley Lin: 		and whatever terrible decision he made about the money.

Stanley Lin: 		Uh. And what do I do if I feel another panic attack coming on.

Stanley Lin: 		Would you be interested in a device

Stanley Lin: 		that links up to your smartphone

Stanley Lin: 		and it keeps track of your vitals

Stanley Lin: 		and it tells you, even before it's happening,

Stanley Lin: 		whether you're having a panic attack or an actual heart attack?

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, that sounds great.

Stanley Lin: 		You would, right?

Stanley Lin: 		OK, that's great news.

Stanley Lin: 		Because it's still in prototype phase right now,

Stanley Lin: 		but my start-up partners and I are looking for investors.

Stanley Lin: 		Like today.

Stanley Lin: 		So will you please let me know...

Stanley Lin: 		I'm going to give you my number.

Stanley Lin: 		If you do end up taking that 10 million dollars

Stanley Lin: 		because we could really make the world a better place.

Stanley Lin: 		Whoa! Oh, jeez!

Stanley Lin: 		Richard.

Stanley Lin: 		Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.

Stanley Lin: 		We met outside the TED...

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, I remember you.

Stanley Lin: 		What... How'd you know I was here?

Stanley Lin: 		Peter Gregory is investing in a company

Stanley Lin: 		that uses GPS in phones to track people.

Stanley Lin: 		That's creepy.

Stanley Lin: 		You don't know the half of it.

Stanley Lin: 		And neither does Congress.

Stanley Lin: 		Are you OK?

Stanley Lin: 		Look, I don't want to waste your time.

Stanley Lin: 		I think I gotta take the money from Gavin Belson.

Stanley Lin: 		At least this way when I blow my eyeballs out

Stanley Lin: 		I'll have some money left for my family.

Stanley Lin: 		Jesus.

Stanley Lin: 		Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

Stanley Lin: 		Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

Stanley Lin: 		is a compression algorithm that blew our engineering team away.

Stanley Lin: 		And what do you think Hooli is going to do with it?

Stanley Lin: 		I don't know. That's their business.

Stanley Lin: 		This is your baby.

Stanley Lin: 		Do you even realize the impact that a compression

Stanley Lin: 		this good could have on the world?

Stanley Lin: 		Getting any file on your mobile phone in an instant.

Stanley Lin: 		Navigation data for self-driving cars,

Stanley Lin: 		mobile medical imagery,

Stanley Lin: 		all transmitting with no quality loss.

Stanley Lin: 		This is game-changing.

Stanley Lin: 		Don't you want to be in the driver's seat when that happens?

Stanley Lin: 		You really want to just turn it all over to Hooli

Stanley Lin: 		and walk away?

Stanley Lin: 		Well, you are not making this easier for me.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm not trying to.

Stanley Lin: 		I mean you're actually making it worse.

Stanley Lin: 		My hands are tingling. I have this metal taste in my mouth.

Stanley Lin: 		Actually, I can't go back in there, so I'm going to go home.

Stanley Lin: 		- Good to see you again. - Let me give you a ride home.

Stanley Lin: 		Uh, OK. Thanks.

Stanley Lin: 		Dude, where have you been?

Stanley Lin: 		Why won't you answer your phone?

Stanley Lin: 		Man, this has grown way beyond AngelList.

Stanley Lin: 		Andreesen, Elevation and like a bunch of

Stanley Lin: 		other seed funds are piling onto this thing.

Stanley Lin: 		I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

Stanley Lin: 		He's out of control.

Stanley Lin: 		What if we took Peter Gregory's 200K

Stanley Lin: 		and built our own company?

Stanley Lin: 		I'm sorry. You said we.

Stanley Lin: 		Who's that in reference to exactly?

Stanley Lin: 		You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

Stanley Lin: 		I mean, right now Pied Piper just does audio,

Stanley Lin: 		but I'm thinking of ways to compress images, video...

Stanley Lin: 		I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.

Stanley Lin: 		Maybe this could be huge.

Stanley Lin: 		Look, guys, for thousands of years

Stanley Lin: 		guys like us have gotten the shit kicked out of us.

Stanley Lin: 		But now, for the first time, we are living in an era

Stanley Lin: 		where we can be in charge and build empires.

Stanley Lin: 		We could be the Vikings of our day.

Stanley Lin: 		- Vikings? - How are you feeling?

Stanley Lin: 		You look super fucked up, to be honest.

Stanley Lin: 		Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

Stanley Lin: 		So you're really about to go tell Erlich

Stanley Lin: 		that he's not going to get his one million dollars?

Stanley Lin: 		Yeah, I don't want to be there when you do that.

Stanley Lin: 		I would like to be there when you do that.

Stanley Lin: 		No, just stay here, please.

Stanley Lin: 		Um, so, I've been thinking about

Stanley Lin: 		this whole Peter Gregory, Gavin Belson thing.

Stanley Lin: 		And, um, I think I'm going to go with Peter Gregory.

Stanley Lin: 		- Uh, which I know means... - Richard.

Stanley Lin: 		I know that you look at me,

Stanley Lin: 		and see a guy who has it all figured out.

Stanley Lin: 		And for the most part, you're right, I do.

Stanley Lin: 		When I sold Aviato,

Stanley Lin: 		it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

Stanley Lin: 		the universal respect of all the ladies.

Stanley Lin: 		But there's always been a hole in my heart.

Stanley Lin: 		Not a literal hole like you would find

Stanley Lin: 		in some babies with congenital diseases,

Stanley Lin: 		but a metaphorical hole.

Stanley Lin: 		I guess that hole is the "what if".

Stanley Lin: 		What if I didn't sell?

Stanley Lin: 		I'll never know.

Stanley Lin: 		And so I guess what I'm saying to you now is,

Stanley Lin: 		you're like me, Richard.

Stanley Lin: 		You want to build something

Stanley Lin: 		and see it through.

Stanley Lin: 		So, just to be clear.

Stanley Lin: 		You're all right with me saying no to a deal

Stanley Lin: 		that will net you a million dollars outright?

Stanley Lin: 		No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

Stanley Lin: 		I'm excited about it.

Stanley Lin: 		Let's see how high this rocket can fly, partner.

Stanley Lin: 		OK. Great.

Stanley Lin: 		That's great.

Stanley Lin: 		Not partners, exactly.

Stanley Lin: 		But everything else is great.

Stanley Lin: 		Call it what you want.

Stanley Lin: 		Always blue, always blue, always blue,

Stanley Lin: 		always blue, always blue, always blue,

Stanley Lin: 		always blue, always...

Stanley Lin: 		Oh! That was a yellow.

Stanley Lin: 		What was that, 17?

Stanley Lin: 		- Pretty good. - Hey, guys...

Stanley Lin: 		Guys, can I just kind of say something real quick?

Stanley Lin: 		I know it's stupid but, um...

Stanley Lin: 		I just want to say, uh,

Stanley Lin: 		I'd like for this company to be different than Hooli

Stanley Lin: 		and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

Stanley Lin: 		Like, let's like not turn this into a corporate cult

Stanley Lin: 		with bike meetings and voluntary retreats

Stanley Lin: 		that are actually mandatory.

Richard: 		And claiming to make the world a better place all the time.

Richard: 		Let's, uh, let's just think different.

Dinesh: 		Don't think different. That's Apple.

Dinesh: 		Let's just... let's just do it.

Erlich : 		- That's Nike, man. - I know that's Nike.

Erlich : 		Fuck it. I don't know.

Richard: 		Let's just make it... Let's just make it happen.

Richard: 		Yeah, agreed.

Richard: 		To his beneficence.

Richard: 		Peter Gregory?

Richard: 		- The Dark Lord. - Of course, the Dark Lord.

Richard: 		Big Head.

Stanley Lin: 		God, he's worse high.

Stanley Lin: 		Always blue, always blue,
